## Libraries + Sources
#### This application used the Spotify API for OAuth and data gathering as well as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the data. The backend was developed using a FlaskAPI which was then deployed on Heroku (CURRENTLY NOT DEPLOYED).

## Using the Web App
#### Currently, the Spotify OAuth is still in "development mode", which means the number of users is limited to 25 and they must be specified on my end with their full name and email [which is attached to their Spotify Account]. 
#### I am currently waiting for approval to switch to Deployment, but until then, if you wish to use the app, please email me at ajaischandi@gmail.com with the required info!
